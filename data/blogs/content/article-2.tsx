                content: `The cost of developing an app varies significantly based on several factors. App complexity, 
        platform choice (iOS, Android, or both), design requirements, and feature set all impact the final 
        cost. Basic apps might start from $20,000, while complex enterprise solutions can exceed $500,000. 
        Understanding these factors helps in better budget planning and project scoping.`

        research typically takes 2-4 weeks and costs $5,000-$15,000. Design phase spans 4-6 weeks, 
        costing $10,000-$30,000. Development phase, the most extensive, takes 8-12 weeks and ranges 
        from $20,000-$100,000. Testing and deployment add another $5,000-$20,000 to the total cost.`

        integrations, maintenance, updates, and marketing all contribute to the total investment. Ongoing 
        maintenance typically costs 15-20% of the initial development cost annually. Security measures, 
        compliance requirements, and scalability solutions also impact the overall budget.`

        Viable Product) helps validate ideas with minimal investment. Choosing cross-platform development 
        can reduce costs by 30-40% compared to native development. Using ready-made solutions for common 
        features and careful feature prioritization also help manage costs effectively.`
